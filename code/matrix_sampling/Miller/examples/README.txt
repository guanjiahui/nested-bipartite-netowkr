examples.m
Several examples, using the Matlab wrapper.

uniformity.m
A simple check on the uniformity of the sampler.

Ehrhart_polynomials.m
Values of the Ehrhart polynomials H_n(r).

hypothesis testing
Computing p-values and histograms for test statistics, in applications to ecology, social networks, and contingency tables. (NOTE: To compute p-values and histograms using a large number of samples (without creating a huge .dat file), see the examples of C programs Darwin.exe and Patterson.exe in code/C_version/.)

total variation distance
Estimating the total variation distance between an approximate sampler and the uniform distribution.
